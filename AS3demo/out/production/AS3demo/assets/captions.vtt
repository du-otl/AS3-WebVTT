Let's prepare some absinthe.
I have some Jade PF 1901 here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000 A:middle
We'll pour 1 ounce of the absinthe
into our absinthe glass.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000 A:middle
There we are. Very nice color!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000 A:middle
Next, we grab our iced water...

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000 A:middle
and place our dripper upon the glass.
(you could also use a carafe or fountain)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000 A:middle
Now, a measure of water is poured
into the dripper. (4-5 ounces)

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000 A:middle
We can see the trails begin to form
in the absinthe as the water is introduced.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000 A:middle
The absinthe louche forms. Cloudy, milky...
we can watch it rolling within the glass.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000 A:middle
When the line of unlouched absinthe is gone
it is a sign that the absinthe is ready to enjoy.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000 A:middle
Delicious - enjoy!
